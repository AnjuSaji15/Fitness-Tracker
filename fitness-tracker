1.	INTRODUCTION

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is challenging in today's fast-paced world. The Fitness Tracker project provides a web-based platform to help users set, track, and manage fitness goals efficiently. Users can input their personalized targets and monitor their progress over time.

Using modern web technologies, the system ensures an interactive experience. It employs Java Servlets for backend processing, JavaScript for client-side validation, and MySQL for data storage. Session management maintains user-specific data across interactions. The project aims to enhance motivation and encourage a disciplined approach to fitness.

This project aims to create an interactive platform for users to set and track fitness goals. It provides a user-friendly interface to input fitness targets such as step count, exercise frequency, and weight goals while offering real-time tracking. Data storage and visualization enable insights into fitness patterns, enhancing personalization through session management. The project seeks to encourage a structured and healthy lifestyle.

2.	OBJECTIVE

This project aims to create an interactive platform for users to set and track fitness goals. It provides a user-friendly interface to input fitness targets such as step count, exercise frequency, and weight goals while offering real-time tracking. Data storage and visualization enable insights into fitness patterns, enhancing personalization through session management. The project seeks to encourage a structured and healthy lifestyle.

3.	PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
i.	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
ii.	Backend: Java (Servlets, JDBC)
iii.	Database: MySQL
iv.	Development Environment: NetBeans
v.	Web Server: Apache Tomcat

4.	IMPLEMENTATION

The Fitness Tracker system follows a structured approach to web-based fitness tracking, integrating frontend and backend technologies for seamless interaction.
i.	User Interface (UI):
Designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the frontend offers a visually appealing and intuitive interface. Users input fitness goals, such as step count, exercise frequency, and target weight.
ii.	Form Handling & Data Validation:
JavaScript validates user inputs before submission, ensuring correct data entry.
iii.	Backend Processing:
Java Servlets handle backend logic. When a user submits fitness goals, the servlet processes the input, stores it in an HTTP session, and redirects to the activity tracking page.
iv.	Session Management:
HTTP sessions store user inputs, preventing data loss when navigating between sections.
v.	Redirection & Navigation:
Users are redirected to the activity tracking page to monitor progress. Future enhancements include real-time updates and graphical representations.
vi.	Future Enhancements:
The system can be improved with persistent storage, AI-powered fitness recommendations, and a mobile-friendly interface.
